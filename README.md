# NerutiDemo 2 - DL4J examples
>   by Neruti Developers

This repo is partially copied from [DL4J Github Examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples).
Partially copied means that we do modify some code and one of the test file is written on our own using dataset from 
[UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
Original marketing dataset can be obtained [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/)
The example of the model is not usable especially for the marketing data.

### Your task after having the test code:
1. Improve accuracy
2. Preprocess the dataset
3. Change the model
4. Reduce the dataset/ Dimensionality reduction
5. Discover your own way and discuss with us in the community chat at https://gitter.im/neruti-deeplearning/demo2-discussion (as this is a public channel, your idea may catch an employer's attention)
6. Raise question/issues in gitter
